Release Checklist
    test 5-man tbs, especially with probe_firm/threadpool
    try some alternate aspiration window strategies, targeting the consecutive
        fail high/low problems noted below.

Search
    Better statistics gathering/reporting
    recognize singular replies
    Try multiple moves in TT, instead of PV cache
    Make pawn eval and king safety scores available inside search
    implement thread pools
    shrink trans table entry size, reevaluate TT code structure

Interface
    ECO classification
    PGN parsing

Evaluation
    Try alternate king safety implementations
    rewrite eval to always work from white's perspective
    static mate threats
    pawn islands
    evaluation hashing

Bugs
    I'm concerned about a root fail-high bug for e7e4 in this position:
    1r1r2k1/2p1qp1p/6p1/ppQB1b2/5Pn1/2R1P1P1/PP5P/R1B3K1 b
        This might be a case of poor mate threat detection. It takes a pretty
        deep search before the eval for e7e4 spikes, and a really long search
        to find the mate, even when only searching e7e4.
        This hits two consecutive fail highs at depth 17 and 18; then the open
        window search at depth 19 takes just about forever.
        Better window size management might be a solution, or insisting on a
        resolved search at each depth.

    Similar problem here: (bm b1h7)
    1qrrbbk1/1p1nnppp/p3p3/4P3/2P5/1PN1N3/PB2Q1PP/1B2RR1K w - - 0 21

    Doesn't understand this simple endgame at all:
    8/8/3k4/7p/R3K1bP/8/8/8 w - - 0 1
        I think MCTS might be a good approach for positions like this
