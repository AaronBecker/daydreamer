Bugs
    I'm concerned about a root fail-high bug for e7e4 in this position:
    1r1r2k1/2p1qp1p/6p1/ppQB1b2/5Pn1/2R1P1P1/PP5P/R1B3K1 b

    Similar problem here: (bm b1h7)
    1qrrbbk1/1p1nnppp/p3p3/4P3/2P5/1PN1N3/PB2Q1PP/1B2RR1K w - - 0 21

    Doesn't understand this simple endgame at all:
    8/8/3k4/7p/R3K1bP/8/8/8 w - - 0 1
