Search
    Better statistics gathering/reporting
    recognize singular replies
    prefetching for trans table entries
    TBB?
    Try multiple moves in TT, instead of PV cache
    Test effects of reducing PV-specific decisions
    Re-write the guts of the move selector, because they're awful now.
    Make pawn eval and king safety scores available inside search
    less distinction (or no distinction) between search and qsearch

shrink trans table entry size
evaluation hashing, possibly material info hashing

Interface
    ECO classification
    PGN parsing

Evaluation
    improved king safety and passed pawn evaluation
    Try alternate king safety implementations
    rewrite eval to always work from white's perspective
    redo report_eval
    more sophisticated pawn shelter scoring
