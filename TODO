    TBB?
    Try multiple moves in TT, instead of PV cache
    Test effects of reducing PV-specific decisions
    Re-write the guts of the move selector, because they're awful now.
    less distinction (or no distinction) between search and qsearch
    smooth lmr reduction curve (with fractional plies)
    try full eval after nullmove fails instead of just for futility

shrink trans table entry size
evaluation hashing

Interface
    ECO classification
    PGN parsing

Evaluation
    add some basic endgame knowledge (opp bishops, etc)
    material imbalance tables
    bounded eval with early exit
    improved king safety and passed pawn evaluation
    Try alternate king safety implementations

Testing
    try different move ordering counts. 16 didn't help. maybe 12.

Bugs
    In mate positions (eg 5k2/8/8/8/8/2Q5/8/3K4 w - -), after long searches the
    shortest mate found will gradually increase in length (ie, a "mate 9" score
    is later replaced with "mate 11")

    Performance on 1nbq1r1k/3rbp1p/p1p1pp1Q/1p6/P1pPN3/5NP1/1P2PPBP/R4RK1 w - -
    (bm f3g5, mate in 4) is really bad

    Performance on 4r1k1/p1qr1p2/2pb1Bp1/1p5p/3P1n1R/1B3P2/PP3PK1/2Q4R w - -
    (bm c1f4, mate in 6) is really bad

    Re-do verbose output in light of Arena parse bugs

    Optimized and non-optimized builds don't search the same number of nodes
