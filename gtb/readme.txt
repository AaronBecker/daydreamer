Gaviota Tablebases Probing Code v0.1
Copyright (c) 2010 Miguel A. Ballicora

This software provides the code needed to probe the Gaviota Endgame Tablebases.
It is designed to be portable to be called from programs running
in Linux and Windows. Most likely it will work in other OS but
it has not been tested. This is a beta version and it is not guaranteed
that the interface will not changed. At least until version 1.0 is
released. This software is under the X11 ("MIT") license (see below).

A very small set of tablebase files is included in this distribution 
for testing purposes (only 3 pieces). They are compressed with four
different compression schemes. For a more complete set, please download 
Gaviota from
http://sites.google.com/site/gaviotachessengine/ 
and generate the 4 and 5 piece tablebases. Instructions how to generate them
and compressed them are in the website.

"tbprobe" is distributed here as an example of how to probe the TBs.
The interface is relatively "low level" to make sure that performance won't suffer. 
Hopefully, the small program tbprobe is self explanatory. A more complete
documentation may be released in the future.
In the future I planned to support an interface with a FEN notation too.

To include this code in any engine or GUI, the following files should be
compiled and linked:

gtb-probe.c
decode.c
possatt.c
sysport/sysport.c  
compression/wrap.c
compression/huffman/hzip.c 
compression/lzma/LzmaEnc.c 
compression/lzma/LzmaDec.c 
compression/lzma/Alloc.c 
compression/lzma/LzFind.c 
compression/lzma/Lzma86Enc.c 
compression/lzma/Lzma86Dec.c 
compression/lzma/Bra86.c
compression/zlib/zcompress.c
compression/zlib/uncompr.c
compression/zlib/inflate.c
compression/zlib/deflate.c
compression/zlib/adler32.c   
compression/zlib/crc32.c    
compression/zlib/infback.c  
compression/zlib/inffast.c  
compression/zlib/inftrees.c  
compression/zlib/trees.c     
compression/zlib/zutil.c
compression/liblzf/lzf_c.c
compression/liblzf/lzf_d.c

The following files will be included 
decode.h  
gtb-probe.h  
possatt.h

plus all the *.h files in the folders:
sysport/
compression/
compression/bzip2-1.0.5/
compression/liblzf/
compression/zlib/
compression/lzma/
compression/huffman/

The following libraries should be linked in Linux
-lpthread
-lm

In Windows, the appropriate MT (multithreaded library should alos be linked)

These switches should be set in the compiler
-D NDEBUG
-D Z_PREFIX

The first one removes the assert code, and the second
one makes sure that some names in the zlib library will not
collision with other names in ther other compression library.

the file compile.sh is an example of how tbprobe can be
compiled in Linux using gcc.

Rafile.rb is the ruby version of Makefile. You have to install 'rake'
to execute it. This is what I use but you don't have to. It is provided
out of lazyness. I should probably remove it.

Good luck with the tablebases!
